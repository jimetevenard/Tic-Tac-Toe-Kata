            The Goal of this Kata is to implement a working Tic-Tac-Toe game.
        </p>

        <p>
            It can be a nice training on coding event-driven programs,
            and more globally on how to decompose a complex problem into simpler ones.
        </p>

        <h2>Rules</h2>

        <ul>
            <p>The rules of the Tic-Tac-Toe game are the following:</p>

            <li>a game is over when all cells are taken</li>
            <li>a game is over when all cells in a column, a row or a diagonal are taken by a player</li>
            <li>a player can take a cell if not already taken</li>
            <li>players take turns taking cells until the game is over</li>
            <li>there are two player in the game (X and O)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="complement">
            In the editor below, you can implement the game in JavaScript.<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="complement">
            For simplicity, the HTML + CSS integration of the board is already done.<br />
            Your goal is to focus on algorithmic logic.
        </p>

            To make it easier,<br/> we suggest you to decompose the work into two main step
        </p>

        
        <h2>Step 1 - Just a board for human players</h2>
        <p>
            The game will have to allow two challengers to play together (on the same computer)
            in the respect the rules listed above.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game must prevent users from making illegal actions, like playing an already taken cell,
            and must detect <em>game-ending</em> situations (a player has won, or all cells are taken)
        </p>


        <h2>Step 2 - Play against the machine</h2>
        <p>
            The second step would be to programmatically implement a computer player that one can
            confront.
        </p>
        <p>
            It does not necessarily have to be a <em>good</em> player, just following
            the rules can be fine
        </p>
